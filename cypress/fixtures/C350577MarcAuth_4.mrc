A mental map shows what the person knows about the location and the uniqueness of a place. No mental map is alike. Every human has his or her own mental map.)  aNational geographic xpeditions archive WWW site, July 10, 2012:b(To be geographically informed, a person must keep in mind a lot of information about people, places, and environments and must be able to organize this information in the appropriate spatial context. A very effective way of doing this is to create and use what can be called "mental maps." Such a map is an individual's internalized representation of some aspect or aspects of Earth's surface. Mental maps have several distinguishing characteristics: Mental maps are personal and idiosyncratic and are usually a mixture of both objective knowledge and subjective perceptions. They contain objective and precise knowledge about the location of geographic features, such as continents, countries, cities, mountain ranges, and oceans. They also contain more subjective and less precise information, such as impressions of places, rough estimates of relative size, shape, and location, and a general sense of certain connections between places as well as priorities that reflect the mapmaker's own predilections. Mental maps are used in some form by all people throughout their lives. Such maps enable people to know what routes to take when traveling, comprehend what others say or write about various places, and develop an understanding of the world.)  t1209v0  aProposal saved by tc03 on 07/25/2012 at 15:32:3002762cz  a2200325n  4500001000800000005001700008008004100025010001700066035001700083040003000100155002100130455001800151455001800169455002000187555001200207670009900219670012100318670008200439670006800521670084200589670029901431670012001730670021801850680008202068910005102150910005102201910005302252952011902305906001202424898051220151208055921.0120213|| anznnbabn          |a ana     c  agf2012025007  agf2012025007  aWaUbengcDLCflcgftdDLC  aUpside-down maps  aReversed maps  aSouth-up maps  aUpsidedown maps  wgaMaps350577  aWork cat.: Hema Maps (Firm).

Thus the Southern Hemisphere at the top of the map instead of the bottom. These maps are just as accurate as traditionally oriented maps, because the position of North at the top of maps is arbitrary. Such maps have been made in several cultures and time periods. The convention that North is at the top (and East at the right) on most modern maps was established by the astronomer Ptolemy and was adopted by other cartographers. In modern times, reversed maps are made as a learning device or to illustrate Northern Hemisphere bias.
