Shakespeare's 'Henry V' opens the Globe Playhouse, but while the actors strut and fret, an excess of bile plagues the populace outside. ... when the company's costumer is bitten by a plague-ridden madman, and the Queen and her men arrive seeking safety, life in the playhouse takes a turn for the worse. As the affliction spreads through London, the Globe is placed in quarantine and the survivors within must fight for their lives. Can they escape? Is there a cure? Is artistic integrity ever worth dying for? A true and accurate account of the Elizabethan zombie plague.")  aKelly, T.
