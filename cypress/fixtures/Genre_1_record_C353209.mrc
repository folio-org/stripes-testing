However, like most euro-cult expressions it has become confused and re-used heavily down the years, most often interchangably with the generic term "Sword and Sandal" leading to many American made films being rather incorrectly classified as Pepla; incorporating the traditional muscleman films as well as historical epics and adventure pictures with a classical/ancient setting (from Ancient Egypt through to around 700 AD) but not including more modern-set historical epics and muscleman films or the Biblical epics of which the Italians shot many during the 1960s; The Peplum should also not be confused with the later "Sword and Scorcery" genre that arose from the success of Conan the Barbarian (1982) and although there is a lot of overlap, the latter distinctly employed more high fantasy and magical elements)  aOf muscles and men : essays on the sword and sandal film, ©2011:bp. 5 (the peplum; pepla; peplum or sword and sandal films)  aGünsberg, M.
