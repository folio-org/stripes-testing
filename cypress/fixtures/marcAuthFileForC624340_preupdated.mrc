A female superhero is sometimes called a superheroine, although this term has fallen out of favor in the modern era. The word superhero originated with Superman, who debuted in 1938, and the stories of superheroes - ranging from episodic adventures to decades-long sagas - have become an entire genre of fiction that has dominated American comic books and crossed over into several other media; Supervillain: A supervillain is a variant of the villain character type, commonly found in comic books. Supervillains concoct complex and ambitious schemes to accumulate power and suppress adversaries. They often have colorful names and costumes and/or other eccentricities. Female supervillains are sometimes known as supervillainesses. Supervillains are often used as foils to superheroes and other fictional heroes.

Further, a fictive graphic novel may be a single short story or a collection of short stories rather than a novel in the literary sense of a lengthy work that entails subplots and other complexities.) p. 17 (Graphic novels are not a type of picture book; that is, they are not stories accompanied by illustrations that largely repeat the content of the written text. ...
