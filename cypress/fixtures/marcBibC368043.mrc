Subsequent to his work, the Joint Doctrine Working Party directed that work begin on the heretofore nonexistent Joint Publication 3-06 (JP 3-06), Doctrine for Joint Urban Operations.  aJoint Staff.bMDA903-95-C-0059.dND001 4726  aArmy.bDASW01-96-C-0004.dAR001 243Y  aSupersedes RAND/DRR-1984-JS/A. 0aUrban warfarezUnited States. 0aUnified operations (Military science) 0aMilitary art and sciencezUnited States. 0aMilitary doctrinezUnited States. 7aUrban warfare2dtict 7aMilitary strategy.2dtict 7aMilitary doctrine.2dtict 7aJoint military activities.2dtict  aMilitary Operations on Urbanized Terrain (MOUT) 7aArmed ForcesxOperational readiness.2fast0http://id.worldcat.org/fast/fst01351844 7aUrban warfare.2fast0http://id.worldcat.org/fast/fst01162690 7aUnited States.2fast0http://id.worldcat.org/fast/fst012041552 aArroyo Center & b1984 Force Development : Technology / (Program for gov).  rRAND/DRR-1984-JS/A  aMARS  a(OCoLC)4135987402928eam a2200493 a 4500001001000000003000400010005001700014008004100031020001500072027002100087035002600108035002100134037001000155040003500165043001200200050002300212245008800235260003700323300004900360490003800409500005900447504005200506506001700558520106700575536004801642536004101690580003501731650003401766650004201800650004501842650003801887650002501925650003001950650003001980650003802010653005202048650008802100650006602188651006602254710006202320787002302382903000902405035002002414in3779278ICU20030527192300.0990416s1999    cauabo   b    000 0 eng d  a0833027328  aRAND/DB-270-JS/A  a(CStRLIN)CRLC409575-B  a(CStmoR) a409575  c$6.00  aCStmoRcCStmoRdCStRLINdOCoLC  an-us--- 4aU167.5.S7bG5 199910aMSEARCH-466 Title 7 Search by "Contributor name" field which has special characters  aSanta Monica, CA :bRAND,c1999.  axvii, 63 p. :bill., photos, 1 map ;c23 cm.1 aDocumented briefing / RAND ;v270  a"National Defense Research Institute / Arroyo Center."  aIncludes bibliographical references (p. 59-63).  aUNCLASSIFIED  aRecent historical events and changing world demographics caused the U.S. military to recognize shortfalls in its urban operations doctrine.
