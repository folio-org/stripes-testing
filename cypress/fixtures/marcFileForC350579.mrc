It was established on September 14, 1965; Pinaesaan University [no access points in OCLC] was begun on 1 October 1954 with only the Law Faculty. Then in 1957, Permesta University [no access points in OCLC] was started. These two smaller universities were merged to become the University of Manado [no access points in OCLC] in 1958, with four faculties: Law, Economics, Letters, and Political Science.  In 1961 the Ministry of Education based on Ministerial Decree No.002/Sek/PU, recognized the newly named University of North and Central Sulawesi [no access points in OCLC] as a state university with seven faculties: Law, Medicine, Agriculture, Economics, Political Science, Letters and Education. After several changes and re-organizations, the university was renamed Sam Ratulangi University in 1965 based on Presidential Decree No. 277/1965)  aWikidata, October 21, 2020b(Sam Ratulangi University; aliases: Universitas Sam Ratulangi; University of Sam Ratulangi; UNSRAT)uhttps://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7408055
