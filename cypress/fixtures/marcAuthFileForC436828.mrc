Tate Modern, in London's former Bankside Power Station, displays international modern art from 1900 to the present day. Tate Britain, on Millbank, London (formerly the Tate Gallery), is the national gallery of British art from 1500 to the present. Tate Liverpool houses the national collection of modern art in the North of England. Tate St Ives, opened in Cornwall in 1993, also manages the Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden. The National Gallery contains Western European paintings from 1260 to 1900. In 1997 the Tate and National Galleries set the cut-off point between collections at 1900 and exchanged works from the other's time span.  aRomantic landscape, c2000:bt.p. verso (Tate Britain)  aTate WWW Home page, Jun. 27, 2000:bhome (the original Tate is now Tate Britain) news (Tate Britain at the original Millbank site in London will open Mar. 24, 2000)  aRLIN, Jun. 27, 2000b(hdg.: Tate Britain (London, England))  aArtist and empire, 2015:bcolophon (Tate Britain, London)  aWikipedia, May 18, 2016b(Tate Britain; Tate Britain (known from 1897 to 1932 as the National Gallery of British Art and from 1932 to 2000 as the Tate Gallery) is an art museum on Millbank in London; it is part of the Tate network of galleries in England, with Tate Modern, Tate Liverpool and Tate St Ives; it is the oldest gallery in the network, having opened in 1897; it houses a substantial collection of the art of the United Kingdom since Tudor times, and in particular has large holdings of the works of J. M. W. Turner, who bequeathed all his own collection to the nation. It is one of the largest museums in the country; the gallery is situated on Millbank, on the site of the former Millbank Prison; construction, undertaken by Higgs and Hill, commenced in 1893, and the gallery opened on 21 July 1897 as the National Gallery of British Art; however, from the start it was commonly known as the Tate Gallery, after its founder Sir Henry Tate, and in 1932 it officially adopted that name; before 2000, the gallery housed and displayed both British and modern collections, but the launch of Tate Modern saw Tate's modern collections move there, while the old Millbank gallery became dedicated to the display of historical and contemporary British art; as a consequence, it was renamed Tate Britain in March 2000; Tate Britain is the national gallery of British art from 1500 to the present day)uhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tate_Britain  aArt of Bloomsbury, c1999: t.p. verso (Tate Gallery);aTate Modern, 2000: p. 10 (Tate Modern, the gallery)  axx00bjk0101350nz  a2200241n  4500001000800000005001700008008004100025010002000066035002000086040003000106155004100136455001900177455002200196455002500218455002800243555001500271670049500286670023100781910005301012985000801065985002301073906001201096985891320150514055905.0141201|| anznnbabn          |a ana     c  agsafd2014026217  agsafd2014026217  aIlChALCSbengcDLCflcgft  aC436828 Action and adventure fiction  aAction fiction  aAdventure fiction  aSwashbuckler fiction  aSwashbucklers (Fiction)  wgaFiction  aSaricks, J.
