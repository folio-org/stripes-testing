Sal admires Dean's passion for experiencing as much as possible of life and his wild flights of poetic fancy. On the Road memorializes the author's real-life adventures with Neal Cassady and epitomizes what comes to be known as "the Beat generation." It is the novel that made Kerouac one of the most controversial and best-known writers of his time.

This decade is being characterized by the appearance and use of emergent technologies under development. This situation has produced a tremendous impact on Medicine and Biology from which it is expected an unparalleled evolution in these disciplines towards novel concept and practices. The consequence will be a significant improvement in health care and well-fare, i.e. the shift from a reactive medicine to a preventive medicine. This shift implies that the citizen will play an important role in the healthcare delivery process, what requires a comprehensive and personalized assistance. In this context, society will meet emerging media, incorporated to all objects, capable of providing a seamless, adaptive, anticipatory, unobtrusive and pervasive assistance. The challenge will be to remove current barriers related to the lack of knowledge required to produce new opportunities for all the society, while new paradigms are created for this inclusive society to be socially and economically sustainable, and respectful with the environment. In this way, these proceedings focus on the convergence of biomedical engineering topics ranging from formalized theory through experimental science and technological development to practical clinical applications00gVolume 1.
