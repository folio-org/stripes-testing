This book recounts the mystery of the Galvez murder and its resolution, an event that captured contemporaries imaginations throughout the Hispanic world and caused consternation on the part of authorities in both Mexico and Madrid. In this work Lentz further provides a readable introduction to the Bourbon Reforms as well as new insights on late colonial Yucatecan society through the vast depictions of the cross-section of Yucatecan people questioned during the decade it took to uncover the assassin's identity. These suspects and witnesses, from all walks of life, reveal the interconnected layers found in colonial Yucatecan society and the social networks of Mérida's urban underclass as well as their unexpected ties to the creole elites and rural Mayas that have previously been unexplored."--cProvided by publisher.  a"Yucatan; Bourbon Reforms; creoles; underclass; trial; independence"--cProvided by publisher.  aIncludes bibliographical references (pages 289-304) and index.10aGálvez y Montes de Oca, Lucas de,d1739-1792xAssassination. 0aYucatán (Mexico : State)xHistoryy18th century. 0aYucatán (Mexico : State)xSocial conditionsy18th century. 7aHISTORYzLatin AmericaxMexico.2bisacsh 7aAssassination.2fast0(OCoLC)fst00818962 7aSocial conditions.2fast0(OCoLC)fst01919811 7aMexicozYucatán (State)2fast0(OCoLC)fst01330523 7a1700-17992fast 7aHistory.2fast0(OCoLC)fst0141162808iOnline version:aLentz, Mark.tMurder in Mérida, 1792.bFirst edition.dAlbuqerque : University of New Mexico Press, 2018z9780826359629w(DLC)  2018016955  a40028235808bHLA2cGendJRLeYBPg509530h606315i180611lPaperm29.95q1j29.95
