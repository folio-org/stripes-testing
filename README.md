## Introduction

stripes-testing is a toolkit for building integration tests against Stripes
UI modules and platforms. This repository contains:

* `accessibility`: axe helper functions
* `bigtest`: BigTest helper furnctions, compatible with React >= 17
* `cypress`: end-to-end tests
* `interactors`: interactors provide "hooks" into components as rendered in the DOM,
  allowing tests written in BigTest, Cypress, etc. to use the interactor's consistent
  API regardless of how the component implementation changes.
